# Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a **face mask detection system** using a **pretrained deep learning model**.  
The system detects whether a person is **wearing a mask or not** from an image or video frame, supporting public health and safety monitoring.

##  Project Overview

- **Type:** Binary Image Classification  
- **Domain:** Computer Vision / Health & Safety  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow (Keras)  
- **Execution Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

The model uses **transfer learning** to achieve high accuracy without training a CNN from scratch.

##  Model Details

- Uses a **pretrained CNN model**
- Fine-tuned for **mask / no-mask classification**
- Detects faces and classifies mask status
- Outputs prediction with confidence score

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Applications

- Public safety monitoring  
- Workplace compliance systems  
- Smart surveillance  
- Educational computer vision projects  

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning and pretrained CNN models can be applied to real-world safety applications, enabling reliable and efficient face mask detection.
